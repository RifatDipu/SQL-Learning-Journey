# 📊 Learning SQL for Data Analysis

Welcome to my journey of learning **SQL for Data Analysis**! This repository contains my notes, queries, practice exercises, and projects as I learn how to use SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo is a personal learning log where I:
- Practice core SQL concepts and commands
- Work with real and sample datasets
